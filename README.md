# Demographic Data Analyzer

A comprehensive Python data analysis project that examines demographic patterns from the 1994 Census database using Pandas. This project answers 9 key demographic questions through statistical analysis.

## Project Overview

This analyzer processes 32,561 demographic records to provide insights into:
- Race distribution across the population
- Income patterns by education level
- Work hour statistics and earnings correlation
- Geographic income distribution
- Occupation trends by country
